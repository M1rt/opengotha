RMI Usage in OpenGotha
**********************

Server mode
===========
Adding, removing and extracting tournaments from the Regisrtry are made from GothaRMIServer static methods.

JFrGothaStart does not do anything about RMI.
    It just memorizes IP address into "java.rmi.server.hostname" property
JFrGotha
    adds (and sometimes removes) a Tournament out of the registry when creating or opening a Tournament

Client mode
===========
The link with a tournament is made from JFrGothaStart by GothaRMIClient.getTournament
